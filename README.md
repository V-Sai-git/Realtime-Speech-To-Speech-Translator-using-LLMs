# Realtime-Speech-To-Speech-Translator-using-LLMs

A lightweight, local speechâ†’speech translator that listens to your mic, translates via Ollama-served LLMs, and speaks the result back in near real time. 
Tested on an M1 MacBook Air with Llama3-8B, Llama2-8B, and Phi-3 3.8B.

Phi-3 was fastest but less accurate, Llama3 slower yet best for quality and regional language support, and Llama2 a balanced middle ground
